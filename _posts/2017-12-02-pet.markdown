[pet](https://github.com/knqyf263/pet) is a great tool for storing snippets that you don't use frequently enough to remember.
An example for such a snippet would be:

{% highlight bash %}
for file in <filter=*>; do convert $file -resize <resolution=800x600> $file; done
{% endhighlight %}

I use this quite often, but done always get the bash loop syntax right.
pet allows to insert variables with default values (e.g. `<filter=*>`) which is very handy.
[Gist](http://gist.github.com/) synchronization is comfortable too, when using different machines or for backups.
